# 32-Bit CPU Datapath
Computer Architecture &amp; Design

This project involves the creation of a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU modeled after the MIPS processor architecture, which is capable of executing a set of 20 instructions.

The design incorporates the PC unit, next-address unit, register file (regfile), ALU, instruction cache (icache), data cache (dcache), sign-extend and two multiplexers components.

Various synthesizable VHDL styles, including structural designs utilizing port maps, processes, and Carry Save Adder (CSA) statements, were employed in the development of the processor.

These designs underwent verification through Modelsim simulations and were subsequently implemented on the Xilinx Nexys A7 FPGA board.
